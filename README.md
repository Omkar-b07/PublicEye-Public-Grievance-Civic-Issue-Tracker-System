## 🌟 Overview

PublicEye is a full-stack civic issue management platform designed to bridge the communication gap between citizens and government authorities.

The platform enables:

✅ Citizens to report civic issues with images and GPS locations
✅ Departments to manage and resolve grievances efficiently
✅ Senior authorities to monitor escalations and SLA compliance
✅ Administrators to manage users, departments, and system rules

The goal of PublicEye is to make civic governance transparent, accountable, and community-driven.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Citizens often struggle to report local problems such as:

* 🛣️ Potholes
* 💧 Water Leakages
* 💡 Broken Streetlights
* 🗑️ Waste Dumping
* 🚦 Traffic and Infrastructure Issues

Traditional complaint systems are slow, lack transparency, and provide limited visibility into complaint progress.

PublicEye solves these challenges by providing a centralized, map-based grievance management platform.
